        <h1>Hello! I'm Farzad, a developer based in Iran</h1>
        <p>
          I love building tools that are user-friendly, simple and beautiful.
          I’m gaining experience in front-end development, focusing primarily on
          Angular. Over the past year, I’ve been working at Sepidz, where I
          contribute to building user-friendly applications tailored for the
          restaurant industry. In addition to my front-end work, I have also
          begun exploring back-end technologies, particularly in C# and .NET,
          and occasionally work with SQL Server Management. I’m always eager to
          connect with fellow professionals and explore interesting projects.
          Feel free to reach out if you’d like to collaborate or learn more
          about my work as a developer
